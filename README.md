## System Design

QuestIsland is structured into 4 key scenes, each with a distinct function. Gameplay progression and user interaction are handled through clearly defined systems.

### Scene Structure

   - Entering a trivia booth triggers a transition to the Trivia Scene

3. Trivia Scene
   - Displays 3 multiple-choice questions for the active quest
   - Player selects answers using the keypad
   - Correct completion unlocks the next booth in the Game Scene
   - On failure (wrong answers), health is reduced and the player is sent back

4. End Scene
   - Shows either the Win or Game Over screen
   - If player finishes all 6 trivia quests: shows Win screen
   - If health reaches 0: shows Game Over screen, resets game

### Core Gameplay Flow

- Player moves freely around the island (WASD + Mouse to guide camera)

- Enemies reduce hearts on collision
- Player health is tracked across scenes
- If hearts reach zero â†’ full game restart
